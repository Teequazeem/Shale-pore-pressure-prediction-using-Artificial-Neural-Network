# Shale-pore-pressure-prediction-using-Artificial-Neural-Network
This project is aimed at predicting pore pressure in a well drilled in the Gulf of Mexico shelf. Three wells are available for this study. one well (EI281) was used as the training well, and EI298 and EI330 wells used as the validation and testing well respectively. Result showed good agreement with the actual pore pressure.
