# Shale-pore-pressure-prediction-using-Artificial-Neural-Network
This project is aimed at predicting pore pressure in a well drilled in the Gulf of Mexico shelf. Two wells are available for this study. one well was used as the training well and the other as the test well. Result showed good agreement with the actual pore pressure.
