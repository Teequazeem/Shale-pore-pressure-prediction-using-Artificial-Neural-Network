# Shale-pore-pressure-prediction-using-Artificial-Neural-Network
This project is aimed at predicting pore pressure in a well drilled in the Gulf of Mexico shelf. Three wells are available for this study. one well (EI281) was used as the training well, and EI298 and EI330 wells were used as the validation and testing wells respectively. Results showed good agreement with the actual pore pressure.
The notebook used for this exercise will be published shortly.
